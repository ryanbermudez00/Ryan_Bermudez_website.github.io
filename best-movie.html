			<h1>Why its such a great movie</h1>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3> I like the movie "The Shawshank Redemption" because of the amazing cinematography, great story, and the amazing actors.  The amazing cinematography is thanks to the director Frank Darabont, and Stephen King's novel Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption.  The story is story of perserverance  and those human storys appeal to many people.  The movie's lead roles are plyed by Morgan Freeman anf tim Robbins, two accomplished actors in the peak of their preformance.</h3>
